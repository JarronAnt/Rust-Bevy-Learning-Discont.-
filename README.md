# Rust-Bevy-Learning

This project is a very basic implementation of space invaders done in order to brush up on rust as well as learn more about the bevy engine 

This is built using bevy 0.9 so things are liable to change and break

NOTE: This project is unfinished as I have switched over to try do a 3D game with bevy
